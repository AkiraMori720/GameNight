                us to pay any fees or making us subject to any usage limitations imposed by the third-party service

                access to such Third-Party Account is terminated by the third-party service provider, then Social Network

                        <Text style={styles.txt}>
                        Option 1: Any legal action of whatever nature brought by either you or us (collectively, the “Parties” and
                individually, a “Party”) shall be commenced or prosecuted in the state and federal courts located in
                [name of county] County, [name of state], and the Parties hereby consent to, and waive all defenses of
                lack of personal jurisdiction and forum non conveniens with respect to venue and jurisdiction in such
                state and federal courts. Application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International
                Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act (UCITA) are excluded from these
                Terms of Use. In no event shall any claim, action, or proceeding brought by either Party related in any
                way to the App be commenced more than 2 years after the cause of action arose.{'\n'}{'\n'}
                Option 2: Informal Negotiations
                To expedite resolution and control the cost of any dispute, controversy, or claim related to these Terms
                of Use (each a "Dispute" and collectively, the “Disputes”) brought by either you or us (individually, a
                “Party” and collectively, the “Parties”), the Parties agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except
                those Disputes expressly provided below) informally for at least 120 days before initiating arbitration.
                Such informal negotiations commence upon written notice from one Party to the other Party.
                Binding Arbitration
                If the Parties are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations, the Dispute (except those
                Disputes expressly excluded below) will be finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration. YOU
                UNDERSTAND THAT WITHOUT THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN
                COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL. The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the
                Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") and, where appropriate,

                the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes ("AAA Consumer Rules"), both of
                which are available at the AAA webapp www.adr.org. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator
                compensation shall be governed by the AAA Consumer Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the
                AAA Consumer Rules. [If such costs are determined to by the arbitrator to be excessive, we will pay all
                arbitration fees and expenses.] The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of
                documents, by phone, or online. The arbitrator will make a decision in writing, but need not provide a
                statement of reasons unless requested by either Party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and
                any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. Except where otherwise required by the
                applicable AAA rules or applicable law, the arbitration will take place in [name of county] County, [name
                of state]. Except as otherwise provided herein, the Parties may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay
                proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered
                by the arbitrator.
                If for any reason, a Dispute proceeds in court rather than arbitration, the Dispute shall be commenced or
                prosecuted in the state and federal courts located in [name of county] County, [name of state], and the
                Parties hereby consent to, and waive all defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction, and forum non
                conveniens with respect to venue and jurisdiction in such state and federal courts. Application of the
                United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the the Uniform
                Computer Information Transaction Act (UCITA) are excluded from these Terms of Use.
                In no event shall any Dispute brought by either Party related in any way to the App be commenced more
                than two years after the cause of action arose. If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable,
                then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be
                illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the
                courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that
                court.{'\n'}{'\n'}
                Option 3: Binding Arbitration
                To expedite resolution and control the cost of any dispute, controversy or claim related to these Terms of
                Use (each a "Dispute" and collectively, “Disputes”), any Dispute brought by either you or us (individually,
                a “Party” and collectively, the “Parties”) shall be finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration.
                YOU UNDERSTAND THAT WITHOUT THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN
                COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL. The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the

                which are available at the AAA webapp www.adr.org. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator
                compensation shall be governed by the AAA Consumer Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the
                AAA Consumer Rules. [If such costs are determined to by the arbitrator to be excessive, we will pay all
                arbitration fees and expenses.] The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of

                applicable AAA rules or applicable law, the arbitration will take place in [name of county] County, [name
                of state]. Except as otherwise provided herein, the Parties may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay
                proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered
                by the arbitrator.
                If for any reason, a Dispute proceeds in court rather than arbitration, the Dispute shall be commenced or
                prosecuted in the state and federal courts located in [name of county] County, [name of state], and the
                Parties hereby consent to, and waive all defenses of lack of, personal jurisdiction, and forum non
                conveniens with respect to venue and jurisdiction in such state and federal courts. Application of the
                United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer
                Information Transaction Act (UCITA) are excluded from these Terms of Use.
                In no event shall any Dispute brought by either Party related in any way to the App or Services be
                commenced more than three years after the cause of action arose. If this provision is found to be illegal
                or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this
                provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent
                jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal
                jurisdiction of that court.{'\n'}{'\n'}
                Option 2/Option 3: Restrictions
                The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between the Parties individually. To

                the full extent permitted by law, (a) no arbitration shall be joined with any other proceeding; (b) there is
                no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize class action
                procedures; and (c) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported
                representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons.
                Option 2/Option 3: Exceptions to [Informal Negotiations and] Arbitration
                The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the above provisions concerning
                [informal negotiations and] binding arbitration: (a) any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or
                concerning the validity of, any of the intellectual property rights of a Party; (b) any Dispute related to, or
                arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy, or unauthorized use; and (c) any claim for
                injunctive relief. If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to
                arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and
                such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction
                above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.
